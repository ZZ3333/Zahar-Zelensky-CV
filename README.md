# About Me

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Zahar, and I recently completed an intensive and highly selective 12-week Software Engineering bootcamp at Makers Academy, the leading tech bootcamp that helps people radically change their careers and land tech jobs.

As a Makers Academy graduate, I have gained extensive skills in agile environments, test-driven development, object-oriented programming, front- and backend development, and the ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. My previous work history and individual projects also demonstrate my strong interest and experience in tech.

I am excited to apply my previously acquired knowledge of finance and ecommerce, as well as my experience working with both large and startup level companies in my next role. I have successfully worked in high-pressure environments with limited time to deliver results, collaborated with software engineers and C-level executives, and worked on several MVP projects. This experience has given me a strong understanding of the full product development cycle.

Through my previous and recent experience, I have gained a deep understanding of what it takes to build and ship successful products in a timely manner. My results-driven mindset and passion for tech will be a valuable asset to any team.
